            <article>Hello and welcome to my first webpage! My name is Christian and I am from the US. Though I am currently based in Singapore, my job as an English teacher has taken me all over the place. My love of teaching eventually led me to my current position as a Professional Development Executive with I Can Read - a premier English Enrichment and education company based right here in Singapore. Although I can't travel as much as I once did, my work connects me with people all over the world. My adventures continue! Next stop: (hopefully) working in full stack development!

            <p>I'll continue to update this page as I work. As often happens with most things in life, I experienced serious hardship at exactly the wrong time. To be more specific: the cooling fan in my laptop died the night before this project was due, so I was forced to restart the entire thing from scratch! On a positive note, this gave me a perfect excuse to practice more web development (as well as the chance to indulge in very expensive coffee. Treat yoself, right? I'm very tired).</p>
